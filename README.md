## User Story Testing


## Bugs and Issues

- Adding in new questions, I didn't understand how the JS code worked before I started. This meant that the correct answers were always the first choice in the list. I had to go back in and correct this manually shuffling the correct/incorrect answers for each question.
    With more time I would rewrite the code to automatically randomise the order of the answers so that this wasn't required.


- Wanted background image to match the question being asked, such as a question about Japan having a picture of Japan in the background. This took some time to figure out as several methods I tried all just broke the JavaScript code and stopped it running entirely.
	With a mixture of Coding coach, stack overflow and chatGPT I was able to link the pictures to the questions and have the background change to match the question.


- Images used aren't ideal. This is because I was using Wiki Commons and filtering to "No License" to make sure we were ok to use those images. This did however limit the number of images available to pick from and I had to get a bit creative with some of them.
	Ideally I would have purchased high-quality stock images to have access to a wider range of high-quality images.
